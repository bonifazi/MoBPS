# MoBPS
Thanks for all the interest shown in our program at EAAP 18.
Because of this we will start directly by doing a open beta version together with a 1-2 page Application note paper - this beta version will consist of the R-package MoBPS itself and the package miraculix/RandomFieldsUtils for computational speed and bitwise coding. 
Explicitly there will be no web-interface at first. Instead we will provide an extensive User Manual and some examplary simulations that should help you perform your simulation.
 
The package is designed in a way to allow for a maximum of flexibility and possible extensions in basically any step of the simulation. In case you feel like a specific functionally or option is missing in the program just contact me (torsten.pook@uni-goettingen.de). 
I would highly appreciate detailled explanation of the genetics/breeding you are trying to model to make it easier for me to add in the options needed in an efficient manner.
 
Planned release: End of September 2018

Current programming projects:
1. General user-friendly input options
2. Extension of the economic cost tracking
